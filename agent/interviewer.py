"""sorting-hat — G3 persona + G8 supervisor routing.

This is the brief's step 2 and step 4. The :class:`InterviewerAgent` is the
warm voice the interviewee actually talks to. It owns the five base
diagnostic questions, asks them in order, handles follow-ups — and, once the
base interview is done, acts as the **supervisor**: it reads the accumulated
signal weights, invokes the matching probe sub-interview, pivots to the
next-strongest probe on a thin result, and closes when a probe lands.

G3 built the base interview. G4–G7 built the four probe ``AgentTask``s. G8
(this file's :meth:`InterviewerAgent.route_to_probe`) wires them together:
the supervisor logic that turns five questions and four probes into one
interview that sorts a person and closes gracefully.

The persona prompt — the craft this whole project's quality rests on — lives
in ``prompts/persona.md`` and is loaded at construction time. Keeping it in a
file (not a string literal) means it can be iterated, reviewed, and diffed as
prose without touching code. Routing is logic, not dialogue: the probes carry
their own voice, continuous with the persona, so nothing here speaks.
